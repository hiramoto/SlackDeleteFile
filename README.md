# SlackDeleteFile
* This app is supposed to have a weekly trigger.
* It deletes all kinds of attach files that exceed 365 days.
* It checks all channels and direct messages.
* It also notify the list of files to be deleted next week.

# As for the deleting file I had to use old powerful token. I would appreciate if you could tell me how to manage with new version token.
